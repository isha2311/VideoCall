Hello! This ia Isha and this is my project for a simple video calling app. This is a video calling app which could be run on localhost. 
To start this app, first go to client folder, using cd client command. Then type, npm start.
Open another terminal side by side and type nodemon index.js
These would open the app and then you could video call.
